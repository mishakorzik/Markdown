# Markdown
#### study markdown from scratch

#### hi, today is a great day to explore the markdown


## Example 1

#### let's start with the text

```
# text 1
## text 1
### text 1
#### text 1
##### text 1
###### text 1
```

# text 1
## text 1
### text 1
#### text 1
##### text 1
###### text 1

#### This is how example 1 works. The more grids, the less text. Okay, let's start with another test
## Example 2

```
---
----
***
****
___
____
```

#### you can now make lines that will separate the text

---

***

___

#### the more stars or dashes, nothing will change, at least 3 dashes or asterisks.

## Exaple 3

```
_hello world!_

# _hello world!_

## _hello world!_

### _hello world!_

#### _hello world!_

##### _hello world!_

###### _hello world!_
```
#### to make the text in italics, you need to add underscores on the sides

_hello world!_

# _hello world!_

## _hello world!_

### _hello world!_

#### _hello world!_

##### _hello world!_

###### _hello world!_

#### That's how everything works, you can make the text large with a slope and small

## Example 4

```

* `Hi there! How are you?`

```

* `Hi there! How are you?`

`Hi there! How are you?`

#### Here is our text wrapped in a frame
