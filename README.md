# Markdown
#### study markdown from scratch

#### hi, today is a great day to explore the markdown


## Example 1

#### let's start with the text

```
# text 1
## text 1
### text 1
#### text 1
##### text 1
###### text 1
```

# text 1
## text 1
### text 1
#### text 1
##### text 1
###### text 1

#### This is how example 1 works. The more grids, the less text. Okay, let's start with another test

---

## Example 2

```
---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

#### you can now make lines that will separate the text

--- 

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores

#### the more stars or dashes, nothing will change, at least 3 dashes or asterisks.

--- 

## Exaple 3

```
_hello world!_

# _hello world!_

## _hello world!_

### _hello world!_

#### _hello world!_

##### _hello world!_

###### _hello world!_
```
#### to make the text in italics, you need to add underscores on the sides

_hello world!_

# _hello world!_

## _hello world!_

### _hello world!_

#### _hello world!_

##### _hello world!_

###### _hello world!_

#### That's how everything works, you can make the text large with a slope and small

---

## Example 4

```

* `Hi there! How are you?`

`Hi there! How are you?`

* It's a test

* _this text is italic_

```

* `Hi there! How are you?`

#### more text can be done without a dot but in a frame

`Hi there! How are you?`

#### or text without a border but with a period

* It's a test

* _this text is italic_

#### Here is our text wrapped in a frame

---

## Example 5

```
- I did not put an end

- I did not put an end
  - I did not put an end

- I did not put an end
  - I did not put an end
    - no, well, I did not put a square

```

#### You can also put a dash instead of a period and make a list

- that's what I put a risk

___

- that's what I put a risk
  - that's what I put a risk
    - no, well, I did not put a square

_____

## Example 6

```

- [x] desing
- [x] Markdown
- [ ] test text

```

- [x] desing
- [x] Markdown
- [ ] test text

#### We proceed to Example 7

---

## Example 7

```

> You can make columns
>> And you can have two arrows

> **this is a test text**

```

> You can make columns
>> And you can have two arrows

> **this is a test text**

#### We proceed to Example 8

***

## Example 8

#### Now I will be a little difficult because there will be many commands

```
<details id="missing-code-coverage">
  <summary>Test Button</summary>

Hello it's a test

Hello world! pass: 7586

</details>



<details id="missing-code-coverage">
  <summary>Help Button</summary>

#### Hello it's a test button

#### _this is not an auxiliary button :)_

`Here, too, everything works and the tilt of the text and the point and frame`

* `so everything is fine here!`

</details>

```

<details id="missing-code-coverage">
  <summary>Test Button</summary>

Hello it's a test

Hello world! pass: 7586

</details>

<details id="missing-code-coverage">

#### Hello it's a test button

#### _this is not an auxiliary button :)_

`Here, too, everything works and the tilt of the text and the point and frame`

* `so everything is fine here!`

</details>

#### As you can see it turns out very nice and cool!
